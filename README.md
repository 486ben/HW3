<h1>The background story</h1>
The Battle of Endor was a significant battle in the Star Wars. It was a major confrontation between the Rebel Alliance and the Galactic Empire on the forest moon of Endor.
In this campaign, you are the commander of the Rebel Alliance army, and you will command the team to fight against the commander of the Galactic Empire!

<h3>Short Story</h3>
You: Attention, all units! This is the captain speaking. Today, we face the Battle of Endor, a crucial moment in our fight against the Galactic Empire. Our objective is clear: destroy the second Death Star and bring an end to Emperor Palpatine's reign of terror. We have a ground team led by Han Solo and Princess Leia, who will disable the shield generator. Our fleet, under the command of Admiral Ackbar, will engage the Imperial forces in space. This is our chance to strike a decisive blow against the Empire and restore freedom to the galaxy. Stay focused, stay strong, and may the Force be with us all!

Rebel Pilot: Captain, we're ready for launch. Our X-wings are fueled up and standing by.

You: Excellent. Listen up, pilots. We have the advantage of surprise on our side. The Death Star's shield generator is our top priority. Once it's down, our fleet can move in and take out the battle station. Stick to your formations and watch each other's backs. We're counting on your skills to get us through this. May the Force guide your flight.

Rebel Soldier: Captain, the ground team has landed and is making their way toward the shield generator. We'll do everything we can to support them.

You: All units, we're about to engage the enemy. Remember our goal: to destroy the Death Star and bring an end to this tyranny. Fight with courage and conviction. The galaxy is counting on us. Let's make this Battle of Endor a turning point in history. May the Force be with us all!
